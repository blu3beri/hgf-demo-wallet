## Context

Everything that will be programmed within this workshop will be done in the
`src/workshop/` folder. Every file exports a function that needs your
implementation the of the specific feature to make the application work again.

## Section 1: Agent Initialization

Before we even begin with creating a connection between two agents, we must
initialize our agent first. This will be done in the `agent-initialization.ts`
file.

The function here is called `initializeAgent` and it should return a class
of `Agent`. A very minimal agent does not need a lot, but there are some quirks
for specific environments, like React Native.
